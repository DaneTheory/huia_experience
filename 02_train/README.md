# Huia Experience - Training our Model

We will now used the saved images inside **02_train/training_data** created with our capture program to customize the poses our **Huia** can understand.

We will use Tensorflow 2 Alpha.

You will need a virtual env with Python 3.7, and I provided a requirements.txt file.

```bash
# install the necessary modules
# make sure you are running python 3.7
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# use jupyter notebook to train the model
$ jupyter notebook
```
