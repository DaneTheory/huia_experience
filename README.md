# Huia Experience

[Huia](https://huia.haus) is a Design & Tech Studio from Brazil and also the name of a rare and extinct bird from New Zealand. This project uses Artificial Intelligence and 3D to digitally recreate an interactive Huia. Using computer vision we map webcam images to understand the user's pose in real time and trigger fun actions.
